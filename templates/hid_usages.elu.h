   The largest HID usage code is AC_Distribute_Vertically from the Consumer
   Control usage page.  Its id is 0x29c, which requires 10 bits.  The largest
   usage page used by a keyboard, on the other hand, is 0x0c, which requires
   only 4 bits.  So we pack the usage id in the lower 10 bits of a 16 bit int,
   and the usage page in the upper 6 bits.
